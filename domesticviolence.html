        Now that the fact is behind me, I can talk about it more serenely. It simply happened and it took me a lot of work to understand my emotions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let’s face it. Women are the majority of victims of domestic violence around the world. For centuries.
      </p>

      <p>
        Nobody knows exactly how it started. This was a way of thinking from which the first wave of feminism began to change (thank you so much, girls!). Historically, it was legal for a wife to be beaten by her husband since he was the authority of the house.
      </p>

      <p>
        In Brazil, my country of origin, every 7 minutes a woman is a victim of domestic violence and more than 70% of the female population will suffer some type of violence during her life. Me, my mother, my grandmother, and my great grandmother are included in this number.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Brazilian government started to recognize this recurring fact as a problem in the 1940s, but only started to act four decades later with the creation of the first unit of the Women's Police Station in the state of São Paulo. A federal law, the Maria da Penha law, which stipulates adequate punishment for acts of domestic violence against women, just came out in 2006.
      </p>

      <p>
        The problem is happening and it is serious since many cases reach death. Violence is a lack of respect. The aggressor has no respect for the other body. It is an invasion.
      </p>

      <p>
        My abuser is the son of another abuser who is the son of another abuser. It was my uncle. It was, because my reaction to the events that followed was to simply wipe him out of my life. I do not feel safe around a person who in any conflictual situation can explode and attack my body. He is 12 years younger than my mother, his older sister, and 12 years older than me. We grew up more like brothers or cousins ​​than an uncle-niece relationship.
      </p>

      <p>
        My parents separated when I was little and they both worked full-time. If they were working, and it was not school time, I was at my grandmother’s house. And despite everything that happened, I am immensely grateful for all her care and love in my childhood years. My uncle lived in her house until his 30s so our relationship most took place in that house.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first incident happened when I was 17. While we were having lunch. He was there, in that mood that used to irritates me so much. He was indifferent to everything, and everyone there. It seemed that he felt like he was the absolute truth about everything in the whole universe. I made a few comments that challenged his absolute certainty. His answer: to throw the glass of juice in my face.
      </p>

      <p>
        I felt very angry and sad. I fought and I left. My dad called him and said some things that must have made him feel bad. Days after the incident he apologized to me. He also sent an apology text to my boyfriend at that time. Clear evidence, that even today, the idea that women are an extension of man's property, is alive and latent in the Brazilian unconscious. I accepted the excuses and we continued to have a relationship.
      </p>

      <p>
        His then-girlfriend became pregnant and he left my grandparents' house. The child was born. A beautiful and intelligent girl, who by great irony looked like me when I was a child. I left my hometown and went to live in another city to go to college.
      </p>

      <p>
        On a mid-term break I was there, to have lunch at my grandmother's house on a weekday, as in the past. My grandmother was preparing lunch and he arrived stressed, arguing with his partner over the phone. A few moments later she arrived and they started fighting in my grandmother's living room. The discussion got heated to the point that I passed to the kitchen and saw him trying to push her out of the front door.
      </p>

      <p>
        He was pushing her out and was trying to close the door. She tried to stay inside and held the door frame. My immediate reaction was to stop him because he was closing the door over her fingers. I grabbed his shirt and pulled, trying to get him away from the door.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the fight started, my grandmother saw that things were becoming intense and went out for a walk with their daughter, who at the time was a little over 1 year old. 
      </p>

      <p>
        His wife left crying and I followed her telling her that she did not need to go through that kind of thing. I also told her that she was not alone and I was available to help her with anything she would need. She left for their house. 
      </p>

      <p>
        I went back to my grandmother's house and he was having lunch as nothing have happened. He told me in a very demanding tone that I needed to buy him another shirt. I answered saying that what I should have done was to call the police because he was attacking his daughter's mother. He immediately threw the glass with water in my face and punched me. I bit his hand as hard as I could and hid in the bathroom. My nose was bleeding. My grandparents arrived. I left the bathroom and said that I was going to call the police, my grandfather said: "you are not going to call the police at my house". I left and stayed months without going back to that house. On the same day, my aunt called me to say that we both disrespected my grandmother's house. When he was 19 he broke the jaw of this same aunt, and my grandparents did nothing to punish him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Violence is how he expresses his frustrations. I already have heard him punching his bedroom wall a few times in acts of anger.
      </p>

      <h5>3.</h5>

      <p>
        On that same week, I had a therapy session with the psychologist I trusted most in my entire life. She was a great help. I remember that I was pure emotional pain. That was a betrayal. After a few days I had a big lump on the left side of my forehead, and I was hurt inside and outside.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sadness and disappointment set in and I was unconsciously withdrawing from the world. Loneliness screamed, but I just wanted to get away from everybody. And so I did. Apathy arrived and find me. I was feeling ashamed to share with my closest friends.
      </p>

      <p>
        To this day I still think: how could he have done such a thing? How can he think of raising his hand to beat his wife, me, his sister?
      </p>

      <p>
        As expected, no talk succeeds in the events. My family expected me to ignore what happened and simply had a relationship with him again. However, I can not accept violence. Domestic violence is an invasion of our bodies and it is wrong, period.
      </p>

      <p>
        The feeling of not being able to share my indignation with my family, and seeing them indignant at that act brought me a lot of frustration. Even after many relatives knew what happened, everyone always ignored it. There was never any conversation. He never apologized.
      </p>

      <p>
        Five years later he texted me. He just wanted to say that family was very important. I said that I excluded him from my life, that I will not tolerate violence.
      </p>

      <p>
        After many therapy sessions, self-analysis, and maturity, I accept that my family, like many other average Brazilian families, considers that normal. For me, it is not and will never be.
